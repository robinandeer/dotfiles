## Backup solutions

- Dropbox (28GB, off-site, versioned, limited space, restricted)
	- clearly organized content of important files (passwords, licenses, etc.)
	- personal photos imported from cameras
	- non-version controlled projects like the movie titles (git gets scrambled by dropbox)
	- generally storage of often and ubiquitously accessed content

- Box (50GB, off-site, versioned, limited file size, restricted)
	- non-mature (test) projects and assets
	- resoureces/assets like backgrounds, photos, videos
	- generally long term storage och rarely accessed content
	- memories

- Time machine (2TB, on-site, versioned, non-restricted)

- Homer (xGB, off-site, one copy, limited space?, semi-restricted)
	- At the start, just for an extra copy of content

- Google + (15GB, photos)

- Google Drive (15GB, documents)

- GitHub (N/A, source code)
	- code that is part of defined projects and related files
	- everything inside of the "projects" directory (mature projects move there)
	- this means that anything under ``~/projects`` is backed up to GitHub
	- I want to keep references of all dotfiles I care about on GitHub

- Evernote (N/A)
	- electronic backup of important papers (scanned)

- iCloud (5GB)
	- should I store anything documents in iCloud? (other than keychain etc.)
	- now: keynote presentations, sketch projects, pages documents, etc.
	- had hidden things from me in the past - I end up with old stuff I should've thrown out
	- stuff that belong to apps like Sketch are obfuscated from the OS
	- maybe store WIP files that aren't version controlled

- LastPass (N/A)
	- Passwords and licenses
